A collection of utilities for Dart and CouchDb

This library is was created out of a need for me to make it easy to deploy my Dart project to CouchDb in a repeatable way.

Many improvements will be made over time, but for now it is functional.

To use the library in it's current form, add the following lines to your dependencies section of your pubspec.yaml file.

  deploy_utils:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/iggymacd/lounge.git
